# Bridge and Torch riddle

Bridge and torch base problem: [Wikipedia - Bridge and Torch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_and_torch_problem#:~:text=The%20bridge%20and%20torch%20problem,a%20river%2C%20with%20some%20constraints.)

This project even steps further, solving the general Bridge and Torch problem with n people and random spawn mechanism, using the algorithms studied from Introduction to AI (such as A*, Uniform Cost Search,...)
